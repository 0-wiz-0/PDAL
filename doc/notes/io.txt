libPC Project Notes: I/O
========================

Given the sheer volume of data being processed by libPC apps, it is very
important we pay attention to I/O speed.

Questions:

* Is C's unix-style I/O generally faster/slower/same-as C++'s stream-style
  I/O?

* Are boost's streams any faster than the native compiler's streams?

* Is it worth providing our own simple unix-style binary stream interface,
  which we use internally, and then letting the choice of underlying
  implementation be made up at the app level?  (LizardTech does this.  
  Maybe GDAL too sometimes?)

* Do we want to spend some time investigating this issue up front?
