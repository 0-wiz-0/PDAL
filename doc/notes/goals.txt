=============
Project Goals
=============

1. libPC is a library which provides APIs for reading, writing, and 
   processing point cloud data of various formats.  Additionally, some 
   command line tools are provided.  As GDAL is to 2D pixels, libPC is to 
   multidimensional points.
    
2. From a market perspective, libPC is "version 2" of libLAS.  The actual 
   code base will be different, however, and the APIs will not be
   compatible.

3. The libPC implementation has high performance, yet the API remains 
   flexible.  We recognize that these two goals will conflict at times and 
   will weigh the tradeoffs pragmatically.
  
4. The architecture of a libPC-based workflow will be a pipeline of 
   connected stages, each stage being either a data source (such as a file
   reader), a filter (such as a point thinner), or data sink (such as a
   file writer).

5. The libPC library will be in C++, but will also include a C API and will
   have SWIG bindings for languages like Python and C#. libPC will support 
   multiple platforms, specifically Windows, Linux, and Mac.

6. libPC is open source and is released under a BSD license.
