libPC Project Notes: Goals
==========================


Project Goals
=============

1. From a market perspective, libPC is "version 2" of libLAS.  The actual 
   code base will be different, however, and the APIs will not be
   compatible.

2. It is a library which provides APIs for reading, writing, and processing
   point cloud data of various formats.  As GDAL is to 2D pixels, libPC is
   to 3D points.

3. It has high performance, yet remains flexible.  We recognize that 
   these two goals will conflict at times and will weigh the tradeoffs 
   pragmatically.
  
4. The library will be in C++, but will support SWIG bindings for Python and
   C#.  We will avoid things that will make SWIG's life difficult, such as
   multiple inheritance.
   
5. The overall architecture will be a pipeline of connected stages, each
   stage being a data source (reader) or filter or writer.

6. The project will be released under a BSD license.

7. *others?*
