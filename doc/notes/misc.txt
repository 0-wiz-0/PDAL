Misc
====

This document contains several issues worth documenting but are not, or are
not yet, substantive enough to merit their own separate files.


Spelling
========

The proper spelling of the project name is libPC (uppercased P and C, 
like libLAS is spelled).


Management
==========

We strive for consensus, but at the end of the day Howard is the benevolent
dictator.


libPC Package Contents
======================

libPC will, at some level, consist of the following parts:

* a set of C++ libraries

* a set of command line apps

* a set of tests

* a set of SWIG bindings

* documentation


Project Dependencies - 3rd Party Libs
=====================================

libPC will use these libraries:


* Boost - for C++ library needs, such as streams or parsers (required)

* libxml2 - Schema description, validation, and serialization (required)

* GDAL - for spatial reference support (and rasterization) (optional)

* libLAS - for LAS (compressed if available to libLAS) support. (optional)

* MrSID - for LizardTech's MG4 lidar format (optional)

* Oracle - OCI (optional)

* libspatialindex - Rtree support, maybe quadtree if someone implements it for libspatialindex (optional)

* *others?*

Some of these libraries may be required (such as Boost).


Project Dependencies - Builds/Infrastructure
============================================

To develop and build libPC, we'll be using these tools:

* Sphinx and rst2pdf - for docs

* CMake - for generating makefiles

* Python - for miscellaneous scripting needs

* *others?*


Buildbot
========

A buildbot will eventually be set up to prevent builds from breaking and to
keep the unit tests passing.


Platforms
=========

We will support these platforms initially, corresponding to what the
developers are using regularly:

* Windows - VS2010 (32- and 64-bit) - 2008 32-bit

* Linux - gcc 4.x+

* Mac - gcc 4.0.1+

By virtue of CMake, other platforms may be supported such as VS 2008 or 
Solaris, but we aren't targeting those specifically.


libPC Position on (Non)conformance
==================================

libPC proudly and unabashedly supports formal standards/specifications for
file formats.  We recognize, however, that in some cases files will not
follow a given standard precisely, due to an unclear spec or simply out of
carelessness.

When reading files that are not formatted correctly:

* libPC may try to compensate for the error.  This is typically done when as 
  a practical matter the market needs support for well-known or pervasive,
  but nonetheless "broken", upstream implementations.

* libPC may explicitly reject such files.  This is typically done where we do 
  not wish to continue to promote or support mistakes that should be fixed 
  upstream.

libPC will always write correctly formatted files.  In some cases, however,
libPC may choose to offer as an option the ability to break the standard if,
as a practical matter, doing so would significantly aid the market.  Such an
option would never be the default behavior, however.

For files that are conformant but which lie, such as the extents in the
header being wrong, we will generally offer both the ability to propagate 
the "wrong" information and the ability to helpfully correct it on the fly;
the latter is generally our default position.
