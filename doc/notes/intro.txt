libPC Project Notes: Intro
==========================

The design, architecture, and implementation of libPC will be captured in a
set of Notes.  Each Note file will, in general, discuss a single topic, such
as Use Cases, Pipeline Design, or Testing.  Notes files are intended to
capture all the decisions made on that topic, as well as keep track of
points still to be decided.

Better yet, these notes can serve as fodder for eventual public
documentation for libPC developers and users.

Notes files will be RST text files and will live in the hg repo under 
doc/notes.

Editorial comments, and points yet to be resolved, are noted in the text
**[like this]**.
