Unit Tests
==========

A unit test framework will be provided, with the goal that all (nontrivial)
classes will have unit tests.  At the very least, each new class should have
a corresponding unit test file stubbed in, even if there aren't any tests
yet.

A test harness will also be provided to exercise each of the command line
apps.


Other Tests
===========

We should also eventually have:

* Large-file testing, to make sure we don't break when over the 2GB or 
  4GB limit.
  
* Performance testing.  (mpg would like to see us put together a set of 
  benchmark files, too.)
  
* Memory usage testing, to make sure we don't leak.
