libPC Project Notes: Apps
=========================

libPC will contain a number of command line applications that are built on
top of the libPC libraries.  This Note lists those apps.

This should be fleshed out to list the (major) options for each of the apps.


pc2pc
=====

Converts from one file format to another, optionally with some (relatively
simple) filtering or processing.


pcinfo
======

Dumps information about a point cloud file, such as:

* basic properties (extents, number of points, point format)

* coordinate reference system

* additional metadata

* summary statistics about the points

The dump should go the stdout, but options should be provided to dump to
XML or similar, where it makes sense to do so.


pcview
======

A simple 3D viewer for point clouds.  Strictly speaking, not a command-line
app.  Will be a Windows-only thing (WPF + DirectX), unless someone else
wants to do something too.


pcindex
=======

Creates a spatial index for a point cloud.  (Could be moved into pc2pc.)


pcmosaic
========

Merges multiple files together.  (Could be moved into pc2pc.)


pcdemosaic
==========

Chops one file up into multiple files.  (Could be moved into pc2pc.)
