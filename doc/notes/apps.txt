libPC Project Notes: Apps
=========================

libPC will contain a number of command line applications that are built on
top of the libPC libraries.  This Note lists those apps.

This should be fleshed out to list the (major) options for each of the apps.


pc2pc
=====

Converts from one file format to another, optionally with some (relatively
simple) filtering or processing.

Input format detection should reside in the app, not in the library.  There 
will be no equivalent meta GDALOpen-like function to do this work for you.  
Too expensive and too easy to screw up.


pcinfo
======

Dumps information about a point cloud file, such as:

* basic properties (extents, number of points, point format)

* coordinate reference system

* additional metadata

* summary statistics about the points

* the plain text format should be reStructured text if possible to allow 
  a user to retransform the output into whatever they want with ease

* the xml format needs an XSD or XMLSchema for validation.

The dump should go the stdout, but options should be provided to dump to
XML or similar, where it makes sense to do so.



pcview
======

A simple 3D viewer for point clouds.  Strictly speaking, not a command-line
app.  Will be a Windows-only thing (WPF + DirectX), unless someone else
wants to do something too.




pcindex
=======

Creates a serialized spatial index for a point cloud. First pass at this 
is to repurpose liblas::Index which supports serialization.


pcmosaic
========

Merges multiple files together.

Does mosaic imply something that merge doesn't?


pctile
==========

Chops one file up into multiple files.  This could be the liblas::Chipper, 
leaf nodes of an index like an R-tree, or a simple quadtree build.
