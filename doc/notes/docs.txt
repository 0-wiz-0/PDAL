Docs

There will be two kinds of documentation: API docs, and Everything Else.


API Documentation
=================

The API docs will be autogenerated by **[doxygen or something]** from the 
header files.

**[need to provide info on what syntax to use]**

These will be available on the website.


Everything Else
===============
  
All the other documentation will be in the form of RST files, e.g. these 
Notes, which will be autogenerated into web page content.  Documentation
content will include:
  
* usage guide for the command-line apps
  
* developer-oriented information like libPC architecture and core classes
  
* information about specific file format readers and writers, e.g. details
  on what versions of the LAS spec is supported

* **[...?]**
