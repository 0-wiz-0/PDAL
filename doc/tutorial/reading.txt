Reading with PDAL
===============================================================================

This tutorial will be presented in two parts -- the first being an introduction
to the command-line utilities that can be used to perform processing operations
with PDAL, and the second being an introductory C++ tutorial of how to use the
:ref:`PDAL API <cppapi>` to accomplish similar tasks. 

Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PDAL is both a C++ library and a collection of command-line utilities for 
data processing operations.  While it is similar to `LAStools`_ in a few 
aspects, and borrows some of its lineage in others, the PDAL library 
is an attempt to construct a library that is primarily intended as a 
data translation library first, and a exploitation and filtering library 
second.  PDAL exists to provide an abstract API for software developers 
wishing to navigate the multitude of point cloud formats that are out there. 
Its value and niche is explicitly modeled after the hugely successful `GDAL`_ 
library, which provides an abstract API for data formats in the GIS raster 
data space.

A basic example
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our first example to demonstrate PDAL's utility will be to simply query an
`ASPRS LAS`_ file to determine the data that are in it in the very first point.
