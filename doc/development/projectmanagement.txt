==================
Project Management
==================

We holds these truths to be self-evident:

* We recognize there are often trade-offs to be made
  between features, performance, and maintainability.

* We strive for consensus in all decisions.

* At the end of the day Howard is the benevolent dictator.

Some day, we hope PDAL to be an OSGeo project with a project
steering committee (PSC).
