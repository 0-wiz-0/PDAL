Stages
===========================

As discussed in another Note, PDAL is designed to construct simple
pipelines, each pipeline stage performing one specific operation (or, where
warranted for efficiency, a stage might perform several specific
operations).  This Note lists all the stages we envision.


Readers
=======

* LAS - 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3?

* LAZ - compressed LAS, likely implemented as a subclass
  
* ASCII / Text

* TerraBin

* MrSID/MG4

* Oracle Point Cloud

* BAG, Fledermaus, other bathy formats

* Pointools?

* Auto - creates points randomly, or as a constant pattern; used only for
  testing


Writers
=======

* LAS - 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3?

* LAZ - compressed LAS, likely implemented as a subclass
  
* ASCII / Text

* TerraBin

* MrSID/MG4

* Oracle Point Cloud

* BAG, Fledermaus, other bathy formats

* Null - dumps output to /dev/null; used only for testing


Filters
=======

* Crop - retain only points within a spatial extent

* Decimate - retain only every Nth point

* Nop - a pass-thru filter

* Reproject - projects each point from one SRS to another

* Cache - maintains points in memory, only reaching "behind" to the previous
  stage if the point needed is not in the cache

* Expression engine - "classification=3;0<=x<=100"

* Transformation engine - "intensity=classification * 2; x = x*3.2808399"

Other
=====

* Indexer - creates a spatial index.  This is kinda sorta a Writer stage,
  but not really.
