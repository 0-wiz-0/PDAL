[tbd]

We will support SWIG bindings for languages like Python and C#.  

We will avoid things that will make SWIG's life difficult, such as multiple
inheritance and templates.

SWIG doesn't support operator overloading, so provide alternative, "regular"
functions that do the same thing, e.g. equals() for oper== and oper!=.

In the bindings, we will not attempt to provide every member function for
the classes, nor indeed will we necessarily provide bindings for all the
classes.  If you really need the "full" functionality of PDAL, you should
probably be using the native C++ interfaces.
