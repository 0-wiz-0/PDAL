Docs
====

PDAL comes with a few different types of documentation:

* the API reference documentation

* the command line applications user manual

* Tutorials and Examples

* the Developer Notes

This documentation is all provided on the website, via Sphinx.


API Documentation
=================

The API docs will be autogenerated by doxygen from the 
header files.

See the Note on Coding Conventions for information on what syntax to use
for this.


Command Line Apps
=================

The command line apps are documented via Sphinx using RST markup.


Tutorials and Examples
======================

Similar to how libLAS was done, the PDAL website will contain a set of simple
code fragments that show how to do basic operations using PDAL.

This documentation will also include sample Python/C# code.


Developer Notes
===============

All development-related documentation, such as design notes, coding
conventions, and so on, will be documented in a Development Notes
section of the PDAL website, via Sphinx using RST markup.
