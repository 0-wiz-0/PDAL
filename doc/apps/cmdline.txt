=========================
Apps
=========================

PDAL will contain a number of command line applications that are built on
top of the PDAL libraries.  This Note lists those apps.

This should be fleshed out to list the (major) options for each of the apps.


App Commonality
===============

The following notes apply to all apps:

* The apps should have a common support/utilities library for processing
  command line arguments, showing version information, etc. -- describe
  boost program_options, and Application/AppSupport classes
  
* Input format detection should reside in the app, not in the library.
  There will be no equivalent meta GDALOpen-like function to do this work
  for you, as it is too expensive and too easy to screw up.

* describe common switches: --version, --help, --verbose

pc2pc
=====

Converts from one file format to another, optionally with some (relatively
simple) filtering or processing.



pcinfo
======

Dumps information about a point cloud file, such as:

* basic properties (extents, number of points, point format)

* coordinate reference system

* additional metadata

* summary statistics about the points

* the plain text format should be reStructured text if possible to allow 
  a user to retransform the output into whatever they want with ease

* the xml format needs an XSD or XMLSchema for validation.

The dump should go the stdout, but options should be provided to dump to
XML or similar, where it makes sense to do so.


pcpipeline
==========

[tbd]


pcview
======

A simple 3D viewer for point clouds, largely for development and testing
as opposed to something for "rea" use.  Uses OpenGL; works under Windows,
should work under Unix too.




pcindex
=======

(future)

Creates a serialized spatial index for a point cloud. First pass at this 
is to repurpose liblas::Index which supports serialization.



pcmerge
=======

(future -- likely to be part of pc2pc)

Merges multiple files together.  (This is also known as mosacking.)



pctile
======

(future -- likely to be part of pc2pc)

Chops one file up into multiple files.  This could be the liblas::Chipper, 
leaf nodes of an index like an R-tree, or a simple quadtree build.
